Who did What
============

Disa and I both equally worked on everything.  We are not just saying this so that we are graded equally.  Literally every .py file and every presentation slide was directly worked on by both of us at some point.  Disa did more of the writing of the code structure, and Stephen did more of the algorithm design.  We each wrote exactly half of the final paper.  Disa made more of the pretty pictures in the presentation, but Stephen talked faster and louder.
